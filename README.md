# Minecraft Skin DB

6,749,939 Minecraft Skins

See [generator](https://github.com/Dinhero21/minecraft-skin-db-generator) for the code behind this project.

Approximately 1 256ths of the project (26,345 skins) (all which started with `00` (each skin is 32 hexadecimal characters)) can be found in this repo since all the images were just too much to host on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and crashed [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

The UUID list used in this project can be found downloaded [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/d8xsan47gbv4l69/uuid_list.txt/file). (found via [this hypixel thread](https://hypixel.net/threads/minecraft-uuid-list-6-700-000.5029428/))

A "Meta File" ([deflate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate) (generated using [node:zlib](https://nodejs.org/api/zlib.html#class-zlibdeflate)) of concatenated raw pixel data (64 width, 64 height, 4 channels, 4096 bytes each)) can be downloaded [here](https://file.io/h4A4wrLj8ZlG).

More technical details on its generation and example use (calculating average and standard deviation) can he found on [research](https://github.com/Dinhero21/minecraft-skin-db-research).
